# Quarto Blog Template

This repository provides a flexible template for setting up a blog using Quarto. It includes customizable components and options for both full blog setups and individual document templates. My address is: [Creo Hsia](https://creohsia.github.io/myblog/) and the theme is inspired by [Typora](https://typora.io)'s [Haru](https://theme.typora.io/theme/Haru/) theme. To ease your blog construction journey, some prior about [Quarto Blog](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html) is needed.
## How to use

### Full Blog Template
To use the full blog template, run the following command in your terminal:
```
quarto use template CreoHsia/quarto-template/blog template
```
This will add the entire folder structure to your projectâ€™s root directory. Quarto will also prompt you to name the directory where the template will be placed.
### Individual Document Templates
If you only need individual Quarto Markdown (qmd) or Jupyter Notebook (ipynb) templates, you can use the following command:
```
quarto use template CreoHsia/quarto-template/template-r
```
This allows you to use pre-configured templates for your files, eliminating the need to set up the YAML configuration from scratch each time. Quarto will prompt you to specify the file name for the newly created document.

Feel free to further tweak the instructions based on any additional details or preferences you have!
